                SPOLIARIUM
            </h4>
        <p>
            The painting features a glimpse of Roman history centered on the bloody carnage brought by gladiatorial matches. 
            Spoliarium is a Latin word referring to the basement of the Roman Colosseum where the fallen and dying gladiators
             are dumped and devoid of their worldly possessions.

            THE PARISIAN LIFE
        </h5>
        <p>
            Painted a few months prior to September 1892, a time when Luna would be “caught up in dramatic events” that lead to a “heroic path”, 
            The Parisian Life has a “playful” and “relaxed mood” that does not provide “the slightest hint of the tumultuous happenings to come” 
            in Luna's personal life.

            ¿A Do…Va la Nave?
        </h6>
        <p>
            FROM PARIS TO CORDOBA TO MANILA: THE JOURNEY OF ¿A DO...VA LA NAVE?

            The present owner of ¿A Do...Va la Nave? acquired the painting by descent from his grandmother, Maria Alberta Esther Susana Pignocchi-Bonaldi. 
            Her husband Jose Domingo Bonaldi, whose grandfather was the first vice consul of Italy to Argentina, received it as a gift from his business 
            associate Goar Mestre, a media tycoon who fled his home country of Cuba upon the triumph of Fidel Castro and the Communist Revolution. 
            Deciding to settle in Buenos Aires in 1959, Mestre then pioneered the television and mass communication industry in Argentina. 
            Known as the “Czar of Television” by the Argentines, Mestre associated with the likes of President Juan Domingo and First Lady Evita Peron.  
            Mestre and Bonaldi, who were close friends, together established the first local TV station in Cordoba, Canal 13. 
            The elements of family and friendship that are interlaced in the story of this painting have become part of the fabric of ¿A Do...Va la Nave?.
